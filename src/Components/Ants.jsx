                Hazrat Sulaiman (as) and his army came across a land on one of their journeys, and in this land, they noticed a colony of ants that were busy following the orders of their leader in different jobs they had been given. Hazrat Sulaiman (as) had been gifted, by the help of Allah, the gift of being able to talk to animals. When they reached the land of the ants, he heard the ant shout, "Oh ants! Run to your houses, so that Sulaiman and his army don't accidently kick you!". When Hazrat Sulaiman (as) heard this, he smiled and said "My Lord, help me to be grateful for all the blessings you have given me and my parents, and help me to good actions which you love". Then he turned to the ants and said, "Don't you know, ant, that I am the Messenger of God and I would not hurt anyone?"
                The ant replied "I was afraid that they would forget God, once they saw your greatness and glory"
                And in this way, Hazrat Sulaiman (as) understood that the ant did not want to scare the ants away from him.
